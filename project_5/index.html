                <strong>WE MAKE THE SHOE. YOU MAKE THE STORIES.</strong></br>We could tell you that it’s the OG
                basketball
                shoe,
                created
                over
                100 years ago. Or that the design has
                largely stayed the same, because why mess with a good thing.
                Or how it became the unofficial sneaker of all your favorite artists and musicians, who each
                made it
                their own. Yeah, we could share a lot of stories, but the one that matters most isn’t ours—it’s
                yours.
                It’s how and where you take your Chucks. The legacy is long, but what comes next is up to you.
                We
                just
                make the shoe. You make the stories.

                <strong>Chuck Taylors Today</strong> </br>High-top and low-top Chuck Taylors remain popular. In
                2015, Converse released a collection of Chuck
                Taylors inspired by Andy Warhol - a significant choice, as Warhol is famous for his pop art
                depictions of U.S. popular culture. In 2017, the Chuck Taylor Low Top shoes were the second best selling
                sneaker in the U.S. and have historically consistently been within the top ten best sellers. The
                affordability of the shoe is a large part of its popularity, but the marketing and history of the
                sneakers as a facet of pop culture give it staying power.
