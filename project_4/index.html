                    A longboard is a type of skateboard.
                    It is often longer than a conventional skateboard and has a
                    wide
                    variety of shapes. It tends to be faster because of wheel size, construction materials and more
                    precise
                    hardware.</strong>

                <strong> Longboards are commonly used for cruising, traveling and downhill racing, known as
                    longboarding. Longboard 'dancing' and 'freestyle' are also becoming more popular styles, in
                    which
                    the
                    rider uses skateboard-like motions and steps up and down the board, generally in a fluid
                    manner.</strong>

                    specially
                    designed 7-8 ply maple plywood deck and polyurethane wheels attached to the underside by a pair of
