    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Hailing from Manchester, Hurts are a synthesizer-based duo featuring vocalist Theo Hutchcraft and
            keyboardist/guitarist Adam Anderson. Known for their arty and striking self-produced videos, Hurts make
            epic, dramatic pop music that takes inspiration from a finely curated mix of influences including '70s
            Krautrock, '80s new wave, and '90s R&B.</br></br>
            Holing up in a basement studio, with the duo now going by the name Hurts, they began focusing on
            a more streamlined, moody, and emotional sound that traded Daggers' edgy pop confrontation for a
            sustained
            synth pop drama. Working via the Internet with Swedish producer Jonas Quant, Hurts recorded three
            initial
            songs,"Wonderful Life," "Evelyn," and "Unspoken." Throughout the rest of 2009 and 2010, the band's fan
            base greweven larger with the release of more songs posted to its MySpace page, as well as videos for
            "Blood,Tears &Gold" and "Better Than Love" and increasing radio play of "Wonderful Life."Having held off
            performing live as they built up their song list, Hurts made their concert debut
            in Berlin in January of 2010. Shows across the U.K. and Europe followed and helped build the band's
            following. </br></br>
            In August of 2010, Hurts' debut full-length album, Happiness, debuted at number four on
            the U.K. albums chart, selling over 25,000 copies in its first week, making it the fastest-selling album
            by
            a band in the U.K. that year. Featuring the singles "Better Than Love," "Wonderful Life," and "Stay,"
            among
            others, the album was huge success across Europe and Hurts' profile rose exponentially.In December of
            2012,
            in anticipation of their next album and in keeping with their tradition of releasing stylish,
            immaculately
            directed videos, Hurts released a long-form promotional video for the song "The Road," which itself was
            inspired by Cormac McCarthy's novel of the same name and J.G. Ballard's novel Crash. Hurt followed up in
            2013 by releasing their sophomore album, Exile, which debuted at number nine on
            the U.K. albums chart.</br></br>
            In 2015, Hurts delivered their third studio album, Surrender, which featured production from
            Quant as well as Stuart Price (Madonna, the Killers) and Ariel Rechtshaid (HAIM, Vampire Weekend). The
            album
            spawned several singles, including "Some Kind of Heaven," "Lights," and "Slow." It peaked at number 12
            on
            the U.K. charts.In may of 2020 the duo released their new song "Voices" and in june of the same year
            announced that in september they will release a new album called "Faith". </strong>

    <h2>Wonderful Life</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Soundtracking a happysad anthem for the dispossessed, the original video for Wonderful Life is
            so
            gloriously sombre and monochrome, it’s almost obscene, although frankly, up here, we could weep with
            joy.
            The angular haircuts, the savage cheekbones, the darkly lit black-and-white setting, the pained
            stares into
            the middle distance… it reeks of eau d’83 – the year when half-remembered bands with achingly
            pretentious
            names like the Lotus Eaters, It’s Immaterial and Pale Fountains took the shaved-sideboards-and-suits
            look of
            post-punk into the mainstream. </br></br>
            The track itself has an epic, cinematic backdrop with noirish synths and brooding woodwinds that
            sees
            seriously self-conscious vocalist Theo Hutchcraft telling the stark story of a suicidal man saved by
            love at
            first sight. The optimistic chorus (“Never give up, it’s such a wonderful life”) contrasts with the
            dour
            verses, filled with references to crying and rain. It’s even got a Spandau-style sax solo to boot.
            Nevertheless, Wonderful Life had to be released three times before it made its middling chart
            appearance at
            No.21 in the UK, though did considerably better ‘on the continent’, by which time a legendary New
            York
            producer had muscled in.

                <em>
                    <strong>Happiness (2010)</strong>
                    </br>
                    Joe Copplestone of PopMatters said that the duo sings "simple lyrical messages of love, pain and
                    yearning that most pop acts could not deliver sincerely if they tried" and claimed that they
                    "have
                    probably released the 'coolest' album of the year", giving it nine out of ten.

                <em>
                    <strong>Exile (2013)</strong></br>
                    Simon Price of The Independent wrote that "Exile employs greater variety than “Happiness”, from
                    acoustic
                    piano to—shock—what sounds like electric guitar, but without sacrificing any of the grandeur.
                    It's often
                    reminiscent of Soft Cell or late 1980s Depeche Mode. It's on close personal terms with
                    magnificence."

                <em>
                    <strong>Surrender (2015)</strong></br>
                    Official Charts "As you may or may not have noticed from the album’s singles Some Kind Of Heaven
                    and
                    Lights, Surrender is a much poppier affair than Exile. In fact, the ratio of ballads to
                    mid/uptempos is
                    exactly 50/50 on the standard version."

                <em>
                    <strong>Desire (2017)</strong></br>
                    The Line Of Best Fit "With their third album, Surrender, the duo began to edge closer to a more
                    upbeat
                    and radio-friendly sound. Desire is the sound of a group who have thoroughly found themselves
                    and sees
                    them standing supremely confident, whilst retaining elements of older material including
                    “Wonderful
                    Life” and “Miracle”. Seemingly, 2017 is the year of the upbeat indie dance record, and it
                    belongs to
                    Hurts."

                <em>
                    <strong>Faith (2020)</strong></br>
                    NME "‘Faith’ has much to offer for fans seeking comfort in the idiosyncrasies of Hurts’ grand
                    noir-pop,
                    and also ushers in new musical kinks and tricks. It hasn’t completely reinvented the wheel for
                    Hurts,
                    nor has it allowed them to rest on old habits. Instead, it presents them at their most open –
                    and in age
                    of isolation, there’s much to admire in that."
